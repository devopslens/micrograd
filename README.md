# Neural Networks from Scratch (Karpathy-Inspired)

This repository contains my personal implementation and exploration of neural networks from scratch, following Andrej Karpathyâ€™s educational series. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how core neural network components work without relying on high-level machine learning libraries.

## ðŸ§  What This Repository Is For

This project serves as both a learning exercise and a reference for building and experimenting with neural networks using only Python and NumPy. It is structured to progressively implement key concepts such as:

- Forward and backward passes  
- Loss functions  
- Gradient descent  
- Optimization techniques  
- Training and evaluating simple models (e.g., classifiers)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This project is designed to run in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), so you can get started without setting up a local environment.

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with Codespaces enabled  
- Basic Python knowledge  
- Familiarity with terminal commands  

### Setup in GitHub Codespaces

1. Click the green **Code** button in the repo  
2. Select **"Open with Codespaces"**  
3. If prompted, create a new Codespace  
4. Once the environment loads, run the following command in the terminal to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
